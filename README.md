# AR-based-music-player
An Augmented Reality (AR) application that plays distinct musical sounds corresponding to different instruments. The application identifies unique markers associated with each instrument and triggers the respective sound. This immersive experience allows users to interact with virtual instruments in a real-world setting.

## Features

- Displays 3D models of a piano, ukulele, and microphone when their corresponding barcode markers are detected.
- Plays a specific sound for each 3D model when its barcode marker is detected.
- Mutes the sound when the barcode marker is no longer detected.

## Technologies Used

- A-Frame
- AR.js
- A-Frame Extras
- Howler.js

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the HTML file in a web browser that supports WebAR.
3. Point your device's camera at the barcode markers.

## Usage

Each 3D model has a corresponding sound that plays when its barcode marker is detected. The sound will mute when the marker is no longer detected.
